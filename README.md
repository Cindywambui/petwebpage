## Description 

This is a practice webpage that I made to experiment my webpage styling skills.The webpage is about my cat pepper.His appearance,age and favourite activities.
It also includes a care and maintenance section which has three sections on cleaning a cat, feeding a cat and how to empty a cat's litter.To spice the webpage
up I added an entertainment section which has a few videos you can use to entertain a cat. I also added a "Book a playdate!" section  where anyone can enter a 
date and see whether or not they can play with my cat.
